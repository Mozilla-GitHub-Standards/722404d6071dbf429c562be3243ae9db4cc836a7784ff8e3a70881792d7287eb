# July Facebook Tab Promotion

A Facebook tab celebrating July with Personas!

## Setup

1. `git clone --recursive git://github.com/mozilla/july-campaign-fb-tab.git`
2. Create a copy of `settings.local.php-dist` named `settings.local.php`
3. Edit `settings.local.php` to add in your Facebook app info.

Note that in order for the Persona preview and installation to work, users
have to add the domain the page is hosted on to their Persona/Extension Install
whitelist via the Preferences -> Security -> Exceptions dialog in Firefox.
